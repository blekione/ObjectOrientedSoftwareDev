# ObjectOrientedSoftwareDev

The purpose of exercises on this module is to learn how to "translate" UML into Java code. We are provided with case studies or UML diagrams and based on them we need to implement Java code. 
I also include some examples from recomended book. The one which I try to understand or check if thats how it realy is.
